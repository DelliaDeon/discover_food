# discover_food

A Flutter project focusing on the user interface of 'Discover Bowl Food', an app for discovering chinese dishes. The inspiration was from a dribbble template.
What makes this different from the others I have built is:
- I focused on making it responsive to all screen sizes.
And dare I say, it was a success
Enjoy!
